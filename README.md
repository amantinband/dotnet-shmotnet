The main table sits under `index.md`. If you aren't familiar with the `^^` syntax in the table, its simply a merge with the cell above (take a look at [Jekyll Spaceship](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship) for more details and other syntaxes provided by this cool plugin).

After the changes are introduced to the `main` branch the deployment should take a few minutes. You can track the deployment status [here](https://github.com/mantinband/dotnet-shmotnet/actions/workflows/build-jekyll.yml).
